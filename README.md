3. Covid-19 Impact Analysis (Comparative Sector Analysis)

A deep comparative study examining the differences between pre–Covid-19 and post–Covid-19 industrial conditions.
Includes extensive preprocessing, trend comparison, statistical interpretation, and visual reporting on sectoral shifts and long-term impacts.

4. Weather Monitoring (Data Engineering Pipeline)

A streamlined data pipeline built for a data engineering challenge.
Designed to fetch hourly weather data from a public API, clean and validate the results, and store them for downstream analysis.
The entire workflow is automated and scheduled using Apache Airflow, demonstrating ETL orchestration and workflow automation.

5. Paradoks Kemiskinan Sumatra: Ketika Pengangguran Jadi Musuh Utama (Dashboard & Policy Analysis)

An analytical dashboard exploring the structural factors behind poverty trends in Sumatra.
Shows how unemployment, uneven labor absorption, and cross-province economic disparities reinforce persistent poverty.
Serves as a reflection and policy compass for data-driven regional planning.

6. Indonesian Independence Day Community Project

A community initiative held in celebration of Indonesia’s 79th Independence Day, organized with the Community Youth Development Association (Karang Taruna).
